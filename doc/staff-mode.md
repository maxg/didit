# Staff mode

Didit is configured with a list of course staff.

<div class="thumbnail pull-right">
<a class="btn btn-xs btn-warning">staff</a>
</div>

Staff can see hidden test results and unreleased grades by enabling *staff mode* with the toggle next to your username.

<div class="thumbnail pull-right">
<a class="btn btn-xs btn-default">staff</a>
</div>

To avoid showing hidden test results or unreleased grades to a student looking over your shoulder, **disable staff mode**.
